# struts1-spring3-action-web30-pagination

This application is based on the famous course made by Mohamed Youssfi (many thanks to him).

This original course is from Struts 2, you can find it at  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8gDGruO1wE>.

I built it for Struts 1 as an exercise.

There is no database, just a Map.

I add a very good pagination taglib from <https://gist.github.com/bijukunjummen/6468547>.
I also add Bootstrap CDN for pagination look and feel.

May be useful.
Have fun.
